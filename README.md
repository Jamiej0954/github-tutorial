This setup is **only** done once in the beginning when the user log into their [Github IDE.](ide.cs50.io)

Follow the following direction to setup your IDE:

1. Configuring your user info
   * In your command line, type the following: `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
   * Remember to use **YOUR** email address, and you need the quote around your email.
